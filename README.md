# medicine-challenge
Write a python script that reads in a file containing patient data, and outputs the average age of patients in the file. The file is in CSV (comma-separated values) format, with one patient per line. Each line contains the patient's name, age, and diagnosis, in that order, separated by commas.

To solve this challenge, you will need to use basic python programming skills such as file input/output, string manipulation, and basic data types.

The CSV file is named `patient_data.csv` and you cannot use any libraries to solve this challenge, only native python code is allowed. Your output should be a number indicating the average age of all patients in the file. For example, if the CSV file contained only the following data:

| Name         | Age | Diagnosis      |
| ------------ | --- | -------------- |
| John Smith   | 35  | Flu            |
| Jane Doe     | 41  | Cold           |
| Mike Thompson| 29  | Allergy        |
| Sarah Johnson| 38  | Flu            |

The output of your python script should be: `33.25` because, in the example, there are four patients with ages 35, 41, 29, and 38, respectively. The sum of these ages is 133, and the average age is therefore 133 / 4 = `33.25`.
